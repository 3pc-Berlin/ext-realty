This extension provides a plugin that displays realty objects (immovables,
properties, real estate), including an image gallery for each object.

For compatibility with TYPO3 CMS 7.6 and 8.7, there is a
[crowdfunding campaign](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BfSmradrQMrcbnABqCpo0gGbgNpfNtGzy94Lpvd8Grk/pubhtml).
If you would like to see this extension work on TYPO3 CMS 7.6 and 8.7,
please consider contributing to the campaign and send the extension author an email:
 `typo3-coding AT oliverklee DOT de`.
